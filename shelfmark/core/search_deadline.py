"""A wall-clock budget for one release search, enforced through the existing cancel flag.

`/api/releases` is synchronous: the browser waits on it while the search runs. Nothing
bounded that wait, and the bypasser's own worst case is minutes long
(`internal_bypasser.max_duration_seconds()`), so a search that ran into an unsolvable
protection challenge outlived every reverse proxy in front of it. The user then saw
"Server unavailable (504)" - a gateway timeout that says nothing about what went wrong
and points the blame at their proxy config. See issue #1276.

The budget is expressed as the cancel flag the download path already understands: an
Event armed by a timer. `html_get_page`, the bypassers and the helper subprocess all poll
it, so an expired budget stops a solve already in flight rather than only refusing the
next one. When it trips, the search fails with a message that names the real cause.

Scoped to a context variable so it applies to the request that set it and to nothing else
- a queued download must keep its own, much longer, budget.
