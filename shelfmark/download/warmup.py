"""Boot-time warm-up of the direct-download source.

The first AA search after a cold start pays for the whole cold path at once: DNS
resolution, electing a live mirror, spinning up headless Chrome and solving the
DDoS-Guard challenge. That is tens of seconds with the user sat at the search box.

Running one throwaway search shortly after boot moves that cost off the user's first
search. It primes the DNS cache, elects (and quarantines) mirrors, and leaves the
clearance cookie in the bypasser's per-domain cache, so the first real search reuses
it instead of solving from scratch.

Runs on a daemon thread and swallows every failure: this is an optimisation, and a
source that is down at boot must not affect startup or health.
