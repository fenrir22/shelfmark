"""GET /api/releases answers within a budget instead of outliving the caller.

Issue #1276: the endpoint is synchronous and had no deadline, while the bypass path it
reaches was allowed ~840s per URL. A protection challenge nobody could solve therefore
ran until the reverse proxy in front of Shelfmark gave up, and the user was shown
"Server unavailable (504). If using a reverse proxy, check its configuration." - which
names the wrong thing entirely.
