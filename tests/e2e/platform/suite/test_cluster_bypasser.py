"""Cluster 1 — Cloudflare bypasser wiring + gated-search behavior.

AA search/detail used to be fetched with ``allow_bypasser_fallback=False``, so a
search behind a Cloudflare gate returned 503 no matter how the bypasser was
configured — which left search dead when AA put DDoS-Guard in front of ``/search``.
Both now pass ``allow_bypasser_fallback=True``: a 403 switches straight to the
bypasser instead of rotating to another mirror behind the same gate.

So these tests assert:
  * the external bypasser is configured from env,
  * a CF-gated search *recovers* once the external bypasser is available, and
  * with the bypasser off it still fails *cleanly* (a 503 the client can act on,
    not a hang or a crash) — the negative control that the gate is not ignored.

Guards: #284 #226 #202 #1030 #410 #369.
