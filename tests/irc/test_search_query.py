"""What the IRC source posts to the channel, and how it orders the answer.

A search bot ANDs every term against a filename, so a given name the channel
spells differently returns nothing at all. Measured against irchighway's
#ebooks: "Revelations David Petrie" was answered "no results", while
"Revelations Petrie" returned 9 matches.
