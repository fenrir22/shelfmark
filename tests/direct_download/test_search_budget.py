"""A spent search budget stops the search rather than starting the next attempt.

One release search fans out: a mirror loop inside `_fetch_search_table`, then a title
variant per grouped variant, then the whole set again without the language filter. Each
of those can reach the bypasser, and `except Exception` around the variant loops was
built to keep going past a parse failure. Applied to a spent budget that meant the
variants queued up behind each other long after anyone was still waiting - which is how
a challenge failure became a gateway timeout (issue #1276).
