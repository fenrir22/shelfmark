"""The untabled-page diagnostic must name the mirror that actually answered.

Regression for #1298. `html_get_page` rotates mirrors and follows redirects internally,
so the URL the search layer passed in is only where the attempt started. Logging that
one made the debug bundle report the untabled page against annas-archive.gl when the
body had come from .pk - the exact triage cost the #1289 diagnostics were added to
remove, reintroduced by reading the wrong variable.
