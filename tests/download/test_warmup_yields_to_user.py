"""The warm-up must not queue its throwaway solve in front of the user's first search.

Issue #1276: the warm-up fires 15s after boot, and the bundle showed a user clicking a
book 13 seconds in. Three seconds later the warm-up started anyway, and because the
bypasser serializes on one browser, the user's title+author search sat behind a solve for
"The Great Gatsby" from 13:41:26 to 13:42:26 - a full minute of a 2m27s wait, for a query
nobody asked for. Once the user has beaten the warm-up to it there is nothing left to
pre-solve.
